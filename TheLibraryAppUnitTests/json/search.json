Flutter is equipped with the powers of Dart as the primary back-end language. For that, Flutter is extremely efficeint in native performances, and it is as fast as other native development tools. Flutter makes the life of a developer easier through multiple hierarchies: First let's you to code once and deploy to many platforms, then it will provides you with beautifully constructed widgets and tools to quickly build what you want. In this book you will learn how to effectively leverage the mighty power of Flutter and Dart in order to create and build professionally designed applications for both Android and iOS in matter of days. We will look at Flutter's many wonderful features and components in order to harness the capacities of this framework. In the first Part of the book, I will introduce Flutter: what it is, how to install it and so on. In the second part, you will learn the basics of the Dart language, For example how to write a Dart code that uses the notion of Classes, Functions, and Control flow statements. In the third part, you are finally exposed to the idea of a Flutter application, we will discuss some basic yet important widgets, the concept of states, working with buttons, inputs, selections dialogs, panels, views and much more. Then we move on to a more advanced set of topics like handling data in Flutter using Futures and Streams, Navigation and Routing in Flutter, defining assets, themes, fonts, using packages and plugins, and in the end, you will see how to deploy your app to the market. Who this book is for Flutter and ultimately this book is primarily intended to be worked by anyone who wishes to develop and design beautiful, native and cross-platform applications. So, I thank you for putting your trust in this book for learning Flutter and I hope the following pages would be of assistance to your future endeavors.",

This book breaks down complex concepts and tasks into easily digestible segments with examples, pictures, and hands-on labs with starters and solutions. In doing so, you'll develop a basic understanding of the Dart programming language; the entire Flutter development toolchain; the differences between stateful and stateless widgets; and a working knowledge of the architecture of apps. All the most important parts of app development with Flutter are covered in this book. Work with themes and styles. Develop custom widgets. Teach your app to respond to gestures like taps, swipes, and pinches. Design, create and control the layout of your app. Create tools to handle form data entry from users. And ultimately create killer multiscreen apps with navigation, menus, and tabs. Flutter is Google's new framework for creating mobile apps that run on iOS and Android phones both.You had to be a super-developer to write apps for iOS or Android alone. But writing for both? Forget about it! You had to be familiar with Swift, Java/Kotlin, Xcode, Eclipse, and a bunch of other technologies simultaneously. Beginning App Development with Flutter simplifies the entire process. What You'll Learn Get the most out of great Flutter widgets Create custom widgets, both stateless and stateful Exercise expert control over your Flutter layouts Make your app respond to gestures like swiping, pinching and tapping Initiate async Ajax calls to RESTful APIs — including Google Firebase! Who This Book Is ForDevelopers who have coded in Java, C#, C++, or any similar language. It brings app development within the reach of younger developers, so STEM groups are likely to pick up the technology. Managers, product owners, and business analysts need to understand Flutter's capabilities.",

This book will help you get to grips with the basics of the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language. Starting from setting up your development environment, you'll learn to design the UI and add user input functions. You'll explore the navigator widget to manage app routes and learn to add transitions between screens. The book will even guide you through developing your own plugin and later, you'll discover how to structure good plugin code. Using the Google Places API, you'll also understand how to display a map in the app and add markers and interactions to it. You'll then learn to improve the user experience with features such as map integrations, platform-specific code with native languages, and personalized animation options for designing intuitive UIs. The book follows a practical approach and gives you access to all relevant code files hosted at github.com/PacktPublishing/Flutter-for-Beginners. This will help you access a variety of examples and prepare your own bug-free apps, ready to deploy on the App Store and Google Play Store. By the end of this book, you'll be well-versed with Dart programming and have the skills to develop your own mobile apps or build a career as a Dart and Flutter app developer. What you will learn Understand the fundamentals of the Dart programming language Explore the core concepts of the Flutter UI and how it compiles for multiple platforms Develop Flutter plugins and widgets and understand how to structure plugin code appropriately Style your Android and iOS apps with widgets and learn the difference between stateful and stateless widgets Add animation to your UI using Flutter's AnimatedBuilder component Integrate your native code into your Flutter codebase for native app performance Who this book is for This book is for developers looking to learn Google's revolutionary framework Flutter from scratch. No prior knowledge of Flutter or Dart is required; however, basic knowledge of any programming language will be helpful.",

Mobile development is progressing at a fast rate and with Flutter – an open-source mobile application development SDK created by Google – you can develop applications for Android and iOS, as well as Google Fuchsia.Learn to create three apps (a personal information manager, a chat system, and a game project) that you can install on your mobile devices and use for real. You will begin by getting a solid foundation of Flutter knowledge, and building on it immediately by constructing two more traditional productivity apps.. You will also learn to create a game, enabling you to see a whole other perspective on what Flutter can do. In addition to building these apps, you'll have the benefit of reviewing real-world issues you might encounter, along with ways to deal with them through tips and tricks, all designed to make your Flutter experience that much more productive and, frankly, fun! Practical Flutter will leave you with a solid grasp of how to build apps with Flutter, and springboard into creating more advanced apps on your own. By the time your journey through this material concludes, another larger one will begin as you springboard, well-prepared, into the larger world of Flutter development, tackling any project that comes your way with aplomb. Practical Flutter is a learning adventure you won't want to miss. What You'll Learn Get a Flutter project started and logically structure it Use the interface elements Flutter provides, such as widgets, controls, and extensions Build layouts using interface elements Use available tooling, specifically Android Studio Leverage server-side development and connect a Flutter app to a server back-end. Who This Book Is For Mobile developers who are looking to build for multiple mobile platforms and trying to do so with a codebase that is largely the same across all. Basic knowledge of iOS and Android generally, and some general programming experience is expected.",
